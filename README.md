# NINJA Warrior

## Goal
Your goal is to defeat three flying vampire bats and a formidable zombie frog in this game, using a katana. 

The challenge lies in managing the zombie frog's fiery attacks, which you can avoid by staying still and gaining a temporary invincibility. 
Strategically move to kill each enemy, 

while carefully navigating the flames to get closer to the frog for the final blow. Success depends on precise swordplay, strategic positioning, and adept flame management for ultimate victory.
